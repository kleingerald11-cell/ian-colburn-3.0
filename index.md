# Oral Histories of Farming along the Middle Rio Grande 

We are conducting oral history interviews with place-based farmers from the Middle Rio Grande with 10+ years of growing experience. We started these interviews in November 2025 and anticipate concluding in Summer 2026. To date, we've interviewed 11 farmers.
