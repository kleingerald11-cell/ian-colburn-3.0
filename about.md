## About the Project
This project is collecting stories and personal histories of farming within the Middle Rio 
Grande region of New Mexico. It emerged out of discussions between members of the UNM 
Food Systems Collaborative and community members involved in food systems work 
during a Spring 2025 workshop. Casey Holland first articulated the idea, then we continued 
to work together to develop it.

The goals of the project are: <br>
1) To contribute to the goals of our community partners to capture place-based 
knowledge that can support resilience in our local food system, document the 
knowledge of experienced farmers, and share this knowledge with others.

2) To provide opportunities for students to learn about and be connected within their 
local community and foodshed, and to learn and practice community-engaged 
research methods.

In the first phase of the project, students in a Fall 2025 Research Methods class interviewed 10-15 farmers using oral history techniques that encourage narrators to share 
their own personal stories, talk about what motivates them in their farming work, how farming has changed since they started and how they have adapted. The oral histories will 
also invite participants to share their own priorities, stories, and ideas in a participantcentered interview. We will continue to conduct oral history interviews through at least 
Summer 2026 and for as long as we have the resources, capacity, and farmers who want to participate. The first 20 farmers who participate will receive a $100 gift card in recognition 
of their time and expertise.

The oral histories are recorded and transcribed. They are not be anonymous because we recognize that these stories and histories are connected to individual experiences and 
want to acknowledge that expertise and knowledge. The transcripts are archived in the Center for Southwest Research at UNM, and in a community archive that we build in collaboration
with our community partners. We are also working on ways to make these oral histories available to the farming community and the broader community in exhibits, 
presentations, and other materials that are most relevant. For instance, we plan to present some stories and begin a shared discussion at the AFSC farmer gathering in April 2026. 
Other classes will also work with these oral histories to build out exhibits, blog entries, and other community-facing articulations. In the long run, these histories may be 
published in public facing or academic research, but that is not the primary goal. The project prioritizes community goals and we have developed this project collaboratively 
with our community partners.
